WAIIAL stands for Why Am I In A Laboratory

This is a horror game, with aspects of paycological horror. If you are not comfortable with this, then you probably shouldn't interact with this.

There is also lore in this game, so if you don't want it to be spoiled, then don't read past the !!Lore!! marker.

I also have a collaborator who will be making the graphics aspect of this, while I will be working on the story aspect.
