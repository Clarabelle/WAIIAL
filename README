WAIIAL stands for Why Am I In A Laboratory

This is a horror game, with aspects of paycological horror. If you are not comfortable with this, then you probably shouldn't interact with this.

There is also lore in this game, so if you don't want it to be spoiled, then don't read past the !!Lore!! marker.

I also have a collaborator who will be making the graphics aspect of this, while I will be working on the story aspect.

PMC stole a book from a sentient library, in turn the library cursed PMC to be bedridden from having arms that felt like they were noodles.
MC wanted to cure PMC, but didn't know of the curse so they went insane from trying to find a cure for PMC
MC needed to make sure the cures weren't deadly, so they tested the cures on humans, or subjects. VS, HS, and FS were subjects who died to deadly cures, ?? Others are interactable in the game ??.
People realised that MC was going insane, and evacuated the lab leaving nothing but MC in the lab. PMC got put in a nursing home. MC died of starvation later, whether self-imposed or not no one knows. PMC died a week later. No one knows why.

You (MC) wake up in the Lab, no memories except for this vague feeling of desperation, or desperately trying to save something important to you.
The lab is deteriorating, having been abandoned for a good amount of 20 or so years.
You explore, happening upon abandoned test chamber rooms, vast expanses of hallway, and many, very many, lab rooms and offices.
Jumpscares when entering rooms (a third or fifth of the time maybe?) of memories of the room.
The further you go, the more horrific the images get.
?? Started at the front of the lab, by the front door, but can't bring yourself to leave the lab. ??
Can explore the Lab at free will, the lab is very maze-like with different sections that you enter in order.
You find different things in the different sections,
