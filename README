WAIIAL stands for Why Am I In A Laboratory

This is a horror game, with aspects of paycological horror. If you are not comfortable with this, then you probably shouldn't interact with this.

There is also lore in this game, so if you don't want it to be spoiled, then don't read past the !!Lore!! marker.

I also have a collaborator who will be making the graphics aspect of this, while I will be working on the story aspect.

PMC stole a book from a sentient library, in turn the library cursed PMC to be bedridden from having arms that felt like they were noodles.
MC wanted to cure PMC, but didn't know of the curse so they went insane from trying to find a cure for PMC
MC needed to make sure the cures weren't deadly, so they tested the cures on humans, or subjects. VS, HS, and FS were subjects who died to deadly cures, ?? Others are interactable in the game ??
